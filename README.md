This is my thrid attempt at this so lets hope it goes well. 
In this project I will be creating a simple website that includes the things I have learned so far. Some of which include headings, text, lists, links and images. 
The areas that gave me trouble the last time was the links and images, they were not organized correctly, I think this time I will be able to do it.
